# Flux Gym by [cocktailpeanut](https://github.com/cocktailpeanut/fluxgym)

Web UI for training Flux LoRA **8GB VRAM support.**

- **Frontend:** The WebUI forked from [cocktailpeanut](https://github.com/cocktailpeanut/fluxgym) (which was forked from [Ostris](https://github.com/ostris/ai-toolkit) (Gradio UI created by https://x.com/multimodalart))
- **Backend:** The Training script powered by [Kohya Scripts](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts)

I wanted to use colab for LoRA training but it appeared service limitations were being applied. As such I was hoping the 8GB optimization settings within the app file would help improve a local instance.
